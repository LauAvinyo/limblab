# Alternative and inspiration

For 3D data analysis, several established tools are available. Fiji and Napari are prominent options known for their robust capabilities in general 3D image analysis. These platforms excel in handling diverse image processing tasks but do not specifically cater to the specialized requirements of limb development data analysis.

Paraview and Imaris offer advanced visualization and analytical features, providing powerful tools for complex data sets. However, these tools lack the specialized functionalities required for detailed analysis of limb gene expression studies. They do not include features tailored to the unique needs of limb development research, such as custom visualization or specific gene expression metrics.
